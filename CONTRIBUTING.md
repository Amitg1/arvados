When making a pull request, please ensure *every git commit message* includes a one-line [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://dev.arvados.org/projects/arvados/wiki/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin). If you have already made commits without it, fix them with `git commit --amend` or `git rebase`.
