All requests to the API server must have an API token.  API tokens can be issued by going though the login flow, or created via the API.  At this time, only browser based applications can perform login from email/password.  Command line applications and services must have an API token provided via the @ARVADOS_API_TOKEN@ environment variable or configuration file.

h2. Browser login

Browser based applications can perform log in via the following flow:

# The web application presents a "login" link to @/login@ on the API server with a @return_to@ parameter provided in the query portion of the URL.  For example @https://{{ site.arvados_api_host }}/login?return_to=XXX@ , where  @return_to=XXX@ is the URL of the login page for the web application.
# The "login" link takes the browser to the login page (this may involve several redirects)
# The user logs in.  API server authenticates the user and issues a new API token.
# The browser is redirected to the login page URL provided in @return_to=XXX@ with the addition of @?api_token=xxxxapitokenxxxx@.
# The web application gets the login request with the included authorization token.

h2. Creating tokens via the API

Use the @create@ method of the "API client authorizations":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods/api_client_authorizations.html resource.

h2. Trusted API clients

The "api_clients" resource determines if web applications that have gone through the browser login flow may create or list or API tokens.

After the user has authenticated, but before an authorization token is issued and browser redirect sent (sending the browser back to the @return_to@ login page bearing @api_token@), the server strips the path and query portion from @return_to@ to get @url_prefix@ finds or creates an ApiClient object.  The newly issued API client authorization (API token) is associated with this ApiClient object.

API clients may be marked as "trusted".  An authorization token associated with a "trusted" client is permitted to list authorization tokens on "API client authorizations":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods/api_client_authorizations.html .

A authorization token which is not associated with a trusted client may only use the @current@ method to query its own api_client_authorization object.  The "untrusted" token is forbidden performing any other operations on API client authorizations, such as listing other authorizations or creating new authorizations.

Authorization tokens which are not issued via the browser login flow (created directly via the API) will not have an associated api client.  This means authorization tokens created via the API are always "untrusted".
