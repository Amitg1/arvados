h2. Resource

Groups provides a way to apply the same permissions to a set of Arvados objects.  See "permission model":{{site.baseurl}}/api/permission-model.html for details.

Each Group has, in addition to the usual "attributes of Arvados resources":{{site.baseurl}}/api/resources.html:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Attribute|_. Type|_. Description|_. Example|
|name|string|||
|group_class|string|Type of group. This does not affect behavior, but determines how the group is presented in the user interface. For example, @project@ indicates that the group should be displayed by Workbench and arv-mount as a project for organizing and naming objects.|@"project"@
null|
|description|text|||
|writable_by|array|List of UUID strings identifying Users and other Groups that have write permission for this Group.  Only users who are allowed to administer the Group will receive a full list.  Other users will receive a partial list that includes the Group's owner_uuid and (if applicable) their own user UUID.||

h2. Methods

h3. contents

Retrieve a list of items owned by the group.

Arguments:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Argument |_. Type |_. Description |_. Location |_. Example |
{background:#ccffcc}.|uuid|string|The UUID of the group in question.|path||
|limit|integer (default 100)|Maximum number of items to return.|query||
|order|string|Order in which to return matching items.  Sort within a resource type by prefixing the attribute with the resource name and a dot.|query|@"collections.modified_at desc"@|
|filters|array|Conditions for filtering items.|query|@[["uuid", "is_a", "arvados#job"]]@|

Note: Because adding access tokens to manifests can be computationally expensive, the @manifest_text@ field is not included in listed collections.  If you need it, request a "list of collections":{{site.baseurl}}/api/methods/collections.html with the filter @["owner_uuid", "=", GROUP_UUID]@, and @"manifest_text"@ listed in the select parameter.

Note: Use filters with the attribute format @<item type>.<field name>@ to filter items of a specific type. For example: @["pipeline_instances.state", "=", "Complete"]@ to filter @pipeline_instances@ where @state@ is @Complete@. All other types of items owned by this group will be unimpacted by this filter and will still be included.
