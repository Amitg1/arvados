To enable and collect health checks and metrics, services must be configured with a "management token".

Services must have ManagementToken configured.  This is used to authorize access monitoring endpoints.  If ManagementToken is not configured, monitoring endpoints will return the error @404 disabled@.

To access a monitoring endpoint, the requester must provide the HTTP header @Authorization: Bearer (ManagementToken)@.

h2. API server

Set @MangementToken@ in @application.yml@

<pre>
  # Token to be included in all healthcheck requests. Disabled by default.
  # Server expects request header of the format "Authorization: Bearer xxx"
  ManagementToken: ...
</pre>

h2. Node Manager

Set @port@ (the listen port) and @MangementToken@ in the @Manage@ section of @node-manager.ini@ .

<pre>
[Manage]
port=8888
ManagementToken=...
</pre>

h2. Other services

The following services also support health check.  Set @MangementToken@ in the respective yaml config file for each service.

* keepstore
* keep-web
* keepproxy
