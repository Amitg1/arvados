This page describes how to enable and configure the collection versioning feature on the API server.

h3. API Server configuration

There are 2 configuration settings that control this feature, both go on the @application.yml@ file.

h4. Setting: @collection_versioning@ (Boolean. Default: false)

If @true@, collection versioning is enabled, meaning that new version records can be created. Note that if you set @collection_versioning@ to @false@ after being enabled, old versions will still be accessible, but further changes will not be versioned.

h4. Setting: @preserve_version_if_idle@ (Numeric. Default: -1)

This setting control the auto-save aspect of collection versioning, and can be set to:
* @-1@: Never auto-save versions. Only save versions when the client ask for it by setting @preserve_version@ to @true@ on any given collection.
* @0@: Preserve all versions every time a collection gets a versionable update.
* @N@ (being N > 0): Preserve version when a collection gets a versionable update after a period of at least N seconds since the last time it was modified.
