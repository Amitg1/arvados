When a user logs in to Arvados, their email address (as returned by the authentication provider) is used as the primary key for their Arvados account.

If you reconfigure Arvados to use a different authentication provider after some users have created accounts, you should either ensure the new provider returns the same email addresses as the old one, or update your Arvados users' @email@ attributes to match the email addresses returned by the new provider.

Otherwise, next time users log in, they will be given new accounts instead of logging in to their existing accounts.
