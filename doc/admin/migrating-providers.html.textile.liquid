This page describes how to enable users to use more than one upstream identity provider to log into the same Arvados account.  This can be used to migrate account providers, for example, from LDAP to Google.  In order to do this, users must be able to log into both the "old" and "new" providers.

h2. Configure multiple or alternate provider in SSO

In @application.yml@ for the SSO server, you can enable both @google_oauth2@ and @ldap@ providers:

<pre>
production:
  google_oauth2_client_id: abcd
  google_oauth2_client_secret: abcd

  use_ldap:
    title: Example LDAP
    host: ldap.example.com
    port: 636
    method: ssl
    base: "ou=Users, dc=example, dc=com"
    uid: uid
    username: uid
</pre>

Restart the SSO server after changing the configuration.

h2. Matching on email address

If the new account provider supplies an email address (primary or alternate) that matches an existing user account, the user will be logged into that account.  No further migration is necessary, and the old provider can be removed from the SSO configuration.

h2. Link accounts

If the new provider cannot provide matching email addresses, users will have to migrate manually by "linking accounts":{{site.baseurl}}/user/topics/link-accounts.html

After linking accounts, users can use the new provider to access their existing Arvados account.

Once all users have migrated, the old account provider can be removed from the SSO configuration.
