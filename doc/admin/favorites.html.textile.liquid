title: Setting favorites for users
...

A "favorite" is a shortcut to a project that is displayed in the user interface (Workbench).  Users can mark their own favorites, but it is also possible to have favorites that are displayed for all members of a group (including the "All Users" group).

The schema for a "favorite" link is:

table(table table-bordered table-condensed).
|_. Field|_. Value|_. Description|
|owner_uuid|user or group uuid|The user or group that "owns" the favorite|
|head_uuid|project uuid|The project being favorited|
|link_class|string of value "star"|Indicates this represents a link to a user favorite|

h2. Cluster wide favorites

The "All Users" group for a given cluster has the uuid @{prefix}-j7d0g-ffffffffffffff@.  Cluster-wide favorites that will show up for all users should belong to the "All Users" group.

Favorites can be owned by other groups, in which case they will only be visibile to members of that group.

h2. Creating a favorite

@owner_uuid@ controls who will see the favorite, @head_uuid@ is the project being favorited, and @link_class@ indicates this record is a favorite.  Set "tail_uuid" to the same value as "owner_uuid".

<pre>
$ arv link create --link '{
    "owner_uuid": "c97qk-j7d0g-fffffffffffffff",
    "tail_uuid":  "c97qk-j7d0g-fffffffffffffff",
    "head_uuid":  "c97qk-j7d0g-khm44br99mz40hk",
    "link_class": "star"}'
</pre>

h2. Deleting a favorite

<pre>
$ arv link delete --uuid c97qk-o0j2j-haadun4x0vmpvnd
</pre>

h2. Listing favorites

To list all 'star' links readable by the current user

<pre>
$ arv link list --filters '[["link_class", "=", "star"]]' --order owner_uuid
</pre>

This will include favorites belonging any group or project that is readable by the user.

Alternately, the query can be restricted to only show favorites associated with the "All Users" group (or some other group) by filtering on owner_uuid:

<pre>
$ arv link list --filters '[
  ["link_class", "=", "star"],
  ["owner_uuid", "=", "c97qk-j7d0g-fffffffffffffff"]]'
</pre>
