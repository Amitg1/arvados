Arvados is migrating to a centralized configuration file for all components.  The centralized Arvados configuration is @/etc/arvados/config.yml@.  Components that support the new centralized configuration are listed below.  Components not listed here do not yet support centralized configuration.  During the migration period, legacy configuration files will continue to be loaded and take precedence over the centralized configuration file.

h2. API server

The legacy API server configuration is stored in @config/application.yml@ and @config/database.yml@.  After migration to @/etc/arvados/config.yml@, both of these files should be moved out of the way and/or deleted.

Change to the API server directory and use the following commands:

<pre>
$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake config:migrate > config.yml
$ cp config.yml /etc/arvados/config.yml
</pre>

This will print the contents of @config.yml@ after merging the legacy @application.yml@ and @database.yml@ into the existing systemwide @config.yml@.  It may be redirected to a file and copied to @/etc/arvados/config.yml@ (it is safe to copy over, all configuration items from the existing @/etc/arvados/config.yml@ will be included in the migrated output).

If you wish to update @config.yml@ configuration by hand, or check that everything has been migrated, use @config:diff@ to print configuration items that differ between @application.yml@ and the system @config.yml@.

<pre>
$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake config:diff
</pre>

This command will also report if no migrations are required.

h2. Workbench

The legacy workbench configuration is stored in @config/application.yml@.  After migration to @/etc/arvados/config.yml@, this file should be moved out of the way and/or deleted.

Change to the workbench server directory and use the following commands:

<pre>
$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake config:migrate > config.yml
$ cp config.yml /etc/arvados/config.yml
</pre>

This will print the contents of @config.yml@ after merging the legacy @application.yml@ into the existing systemwide @config.yml@.  It may be redirected to a file and copied to @/etc/arvados/config.yml@ (it is safe to copy over, all configuration items from the existing @/etc/arvados/config.yml@ will be included in the migrated output).

If you wish to update @config.yml@ configuration by hand, or check that everything has been migrated, use @config:diff@ to print configuration items that differ between @application.yml@ and the system @config.yml@.

<pre>
$ RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake config:diff
</pre>

This command will also report if no migrations are required.

h2. crunch-dispatch-slurm

Currently only reads @InstanceTypes@ from centralized configuration.  Still requires component-specific configuration file.

h2. keepstore

Currently only reads @RemoteClusters@ from centralized configuration.  Still requires component-specific configuration file.

h2(#keepproxy). keepproxy

The legacy keepproxy config (loaded from @/etc/arvados/keepproxy/keepproxy.yml@ or a different location specified via -legacy-keepproxy-config command line argument) takes precedence over the centralized config. After you migrate everything from the legacy config to the centralized config, you should delete @/etc/arvados/keepproxy/keepproxy.yml@ and stop using the -legacy-keepproxy-config argument.

Also, configuration via individual command line arguments is no longer available and the @DisableGet@, @DisablePut@, and @PIDFile@ configuration options are no longer supported. If you are still using the legacy config at @/etc/arvados/keepproxy/keepproxy.yml@ and @DisableGet@ or @DisablePut@ are set to true or @PIDFile@ has a value, keepproxy will produce an error and fail to start.

h2. arvados-controller

Already uses centralized config exclusively.  No migration needed.

h2. arvados-dispatch-cloud

Already uses centralized config exclusively.  No migration needed.
