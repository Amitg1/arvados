Arvados is migrating to a centralized configuration file for all components.  The centralized Arvados configuration is @/etc/arvados/config.yml@.  Components that support the new centralized configuration are listed below.

h2. API server

The legacy API server configuration is stored in @config/application.yml@ and @config/database.yml@.  After migration to @/etc/arvados/config.yml@, both of these files should be moved out of the way and/or deleted.

Change to the API server directory and use the following commands:

<pre>
$ bundle exec rake config:migrate > config.yml
$ cp config.yml /etc/arvados/config.yml
</pre>

This will print the contents of @config.yml@ after merging with legacy @application.yml@.  It may then be redirected to a file and copied to @/etc/arvados/config.yml@.

If you wish to update @config.yml@ configuration by hand, or check that everything has been migrated, use @config:diff@ to print configuration items that differ between @application.yml@ and the system @config.yml@.

<pre>
$ bundle exec rake config:diff
</pre>

This command will also report if no migrations are required.

h2. arvados-controller

Only supports centralized config file.  No migration needed.

h2. arvados-dispatch-cloud

Only supports centralized config file.  No migration needed.
