Collection's managed properties allow a cluster administrator to enable some special behaviors regarding properties at creation & update times.
This page describes how to enable and configure these behaviors on the API server.

h3. API Server configuration

The @Collections.ManagedProperties@ setting from the @config.yml@ file is used for enabling any of the following behaviors:

h4. Pre-assigned property key & value

For every newly created collection, assign a predefined key/value pair if it isn't already passed at creation time:

<pre>
Collections:
  ManagedProperties:
    foo: {value: bar}
</pre>

h4. Original owner UUID

This behavior will assign to a property key the UUID of the user who owns the collection's contaning project.

<pre>
Collections:
  ManagedProperties:
    responsible_person_uuid: {function: original_owner}
</pre>

h4. Protected properties

If there's a need to prevent a non-admin user from modifying a specific property, even by its owner, the @protected@ attribute can be set to @true@, like so:

<pre>
Collections:
  ManagedProperties:
    responsible_person_uuid: {function: original_owner, protected: true}
</pre>

This property can be applied to any of the defined managed properties. If missing, it's assumed as being @false@ by default.
