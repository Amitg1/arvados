Arvados supports federated workflows, where different step of a running workflow execute on different clusters.  This supports running analysis on geographically dispersed data (avoiding expensive data transfers by sending the computation to the data) or in "hybrid cloud" configurations where an on-premise cluster can expand its capabilities by sending work to a cloud-base cluster.
