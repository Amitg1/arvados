To support running analysis on geographically dispersed data (avoiding expensive data transfers by sending the computation to the data) and "hybrid cloud" configurations where an on-premise cluster can expand its capabilities by delegating work to a cloud-base cluster, Arvados supports federated workflows.  In a federated workflow, different steps of a workflow may execute on different clusters.  Arvados manages data transfer and delegation of credentials, so this as easy as simply adding cluster target hints to your existing workflow.
