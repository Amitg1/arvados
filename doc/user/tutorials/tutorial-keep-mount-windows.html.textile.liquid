Windows users can browse Keep read-only via WebDAV. Specific collections can also be accessed read-write via WebDAV.

h3. Browsing Keep (read-only)

Use the 'Map network drive' functionality, and enter @https://collections.uuid_prefix.your.domain/@ in the Folder field. When prompted for credentials, you can fill in an arbitrary string for @Username@, it is ignored by Arvados. Windows will not accept an empty @Username@. Put a valid Arvados token in the @Password@ field.

This mount is read-only. Write support for the @/users/@ directory is planned for a future release.
