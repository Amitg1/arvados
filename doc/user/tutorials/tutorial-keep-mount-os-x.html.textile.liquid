OS X users can browse Keep read-only via WebDAV. Specific collections can also be accessed read-write via WebDAV.

FIXME

This mount is read-only. Write support for the @/users/@ directory is planned for a future release.

h3. Accessing a specific collection in Keep (read-write)

FIXME

This collection is now accessible read/write.
