Users of macOS can browse Keep read-only via WebDAV. Specific collections can also be accessed read-write via WebDAV.

h3. Browsing Keep in Finder (read-only)

In Finder, use "Connect to Server..." under the "Go" menu and enter @https://collections.ClusterID.example.com/@ in popup dialog. When prompted for credentials, enter username "arvados" and paste a valid Arvados token for the @Password@ field.

This mount is read-only. Write support for the @/users/@ directory is planned for a future release.

In Finder, use "Connect to Server..." under the "Go" menu and enter @https://collections.ClusterID.example.com/c=your-collection-uuid@ in popup dialog. When prompted for credentials, put a valid Arvados token in the @Password@ field and anything in the Name field (it will be ignored by Arvados).
