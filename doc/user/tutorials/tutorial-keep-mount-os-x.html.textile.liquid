OS X users can browse Keep read-only via WebDAV. Specific collections can also be accessed read-write via WebDAV.

h3. Browsing Keep (read-only)

In Finder, use "Connect to Server..." under the "Go" menu and enter @https://collections.uuid_prefix.your.domain/@ in popup dialog. When prompted for credentials, put a valid Arvados token in the @Password@ field and anything in the Name field (it will be ignored by Arvados).

This mount is read-only. Write support for the @/users/@ directory is planned for a future release.
