Many operations in Arvados can be performed using either the web Workbench or through command line tools.  Some operations can only be done using the command line.

To use the command line tools, you can either log into an Arvados-managed VM instance where those tools are pre-installed, or install the Arvados tools on your own system.

To log into an Arvados-managed VM, see instructions for "Webshell":{{site.baseurl}}/user/getting_started/vm-login-with-webshell.html or "Unix":{{site.baseurl}}/user/getting_started/ssh-access-unix.html or "Windows":{{site.baseurl}}/user/getting_started/ssh-access-windows.html .

To install the Arvados tools on your own system, you should install the "Command line SDK":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/cli/install.html (requires Ruby) and "Python SDK":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/python/sdk-python.html (requires Python).  You may also want to install "arvados-cwl-runner":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/python/arvados-cwl-runner.html to submit workflows and "arvados-fuse":{{site.baseurl}}/sdk/python/arvados-fuse.html to mount keep as a filesystem.

Once you are logged in or have command line tools installed, see "getting an API token":{{site.baseurl}}/user/reference/api-tokens.html and "check your environment":{{site.baseurl}}/user/getting_started/check-environment.html .
