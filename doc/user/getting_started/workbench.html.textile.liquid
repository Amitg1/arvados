This guide covers the classic Arvados Workbench web application, sometimes referred to as "Workbench 1".  There is also a new Workbench web application under development called "Workbench 2".  Sites which have both Workbench applications installed will have a dropdown menu option "Switch to Workbench 2" to switch between versions.

This guide will be updated to cover "Workbench 2" in the future.

If you are using the "playground" Arvados instance for this guide, you can Access Arvados Workbench using this link:

<a href="{{site.arvados_workbench_host}}/" target="_blank">{{site.arvados_workbench_host}}/</a>

(If you are using a different Arvados instance than the default for this guide, replace *{{ site.arvados_workbench_host }}* with your private instance in all of the examples in this guide.)

You will be asked to log in.  Arvados uses only your name and email address for identification, and will never access any personal information.  If you are accessing Arvados for the first time, the Workbench may indicate your account status is *New / inactive*.  If this is the case, contact the administrator of the Arvados instance to request activation of your account.

Once your account is active, logging in to the Workbench will present you with the Dashboard. This gives a summary of your projects and recent activity in the Arvados instance.  You are now ready to "upload data":{{ site.baseurl }}/user/tutorials/tutorial-keep.html or "run your first workflow.":{{ site.baseurl }}/user/tutorials/tutorial-workflow-workbench.html
