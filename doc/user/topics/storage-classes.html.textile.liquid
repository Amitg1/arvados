Storage classes (alternately known as "storage tiers") allow you to control which volumes should be used to store particular collection data blocks.  This can be used to implement data storage policies such as moving data to archival storage.

Desired storage classes are specified by setting the "storage_classes_desired" field of a Collection.  For example, at the command line:

<pre>
$ arv collection update --uuid zzzzz-4zz18-dhhm0ay8k8cqkvg --collection '{"storage_classes_desired": ["archival"]}'
</pre>

By setting "storage_classes_desired" to "archival", the blocks that make up the collection will be preferentially moved to keepstore volumes which are configured with the "archival" storage class.

You may also specify the desired storage class when using @arv-put@:

<pre>
$ arv-put --storage-classes=hot myfile.txt
</pre>

Collection blocks will be in the "default" storage class if not otherwise specified.

A collection may have only specify one desired storage class.

A user with write access to a collection may set any storage class.

Names of storage classes are internal to the cluster and decided by the administrator.  Aside from "default", Arvados currently does not define any standard storage class names.
