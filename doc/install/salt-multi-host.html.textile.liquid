h2(#saltstack). Install Saltstack

If you already have a Saltstack environment you can skip this section.

The simplest way to get Salt up and running on a node is to use the bootstrap script they provide:

<notextile>
<pre><code>curl -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com -o /tmp/bootstrap_salt.sh
sudo sh /tmp/bootstrap_salt.sh -XUdfP -x python3
</code></pre>
</notextile>

For more information check "Saltstack's documentation":https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/index.html

h2(#dependencies). Install dependencies

Arvados depends in a few applications and packages (postgresql, nginx+passenger, ruby) that can also be installed using their respective Saltstack formulas.

The formulas we use are:

* "postgres":https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/postgres-formula.git
* "nginx":https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/nginx-formula.git
* "docker":https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/docker-formula.git
* "locale":https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/locale-formula.git

There are example Salt pillar files for each of those formulas in the "test/salt/pillar/examples":https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/arvados-formula/tree/master/test/salt/pillar/examples directory. As they are, they allow you to get all the main Arvados components up and running.

h2(#saltstack). Install Arvados using Saltstack

This is a source-based installation method. The Salt scripts are available from the "tools/salt-install":https://github.com/arvados/arvados/tree/master/tools/salt-install directory in the Arvados git repository.

The Arvados formula we maintain is located in the Saltstack's community repository of formulas:

* "arvados-formula":https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/arvados-formula.git

The @development@ version lives in our own repository

* "arvados-formula development":https://github.com/arvados/arvados-formula.git

This last one might break from time to time, as we try and add new features. Use with caution.

As much as possible, we try to keep it up to date, with example pillars to help you deploy Arvados.

For those familiar with Saltstack, the process to get it deployed is similar to any other formula:

1. Fork/copy the formula to your Salt master host.
2. Edit the Arvados, nginx, postgres, locale and docker pillars to match your desired configuration.
3. Run a @state.apply@ to get it deployed.

h2(#final_steps). DNS configuration

After the setup is done, you need to set up your DNS to be able to access the cluster.

The simplest way to do this is to edit your @/etc/hosts@ file (as root):

<notextile>
<pre><code>export CLUSTER="arva2"
export DOMAIN="arv.local"
export HOST_IP="127.0.0.2"    # This is valid either if installing in your computer directly
                              # or in a Vagrant VM. If you're installing it on a remote host
                              # just change the IP to match that of the host.
echo "${HOST_IP} api keep keep0 collections download ws workbench workbench2 ${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} api.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} keep.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} keep0.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} collections.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} download.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} ws.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} workbench.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN} workbench2.${CLUSTER}.${DOMAIN}" >> /etc/hosts
</code></pre>
</notextile>

h2(#initial_user). Initial user and login

At this point you should be able to log into the Arvados cluster.

If you did not change the defaults, the initial URL will be:

* https://workbench.arva2.arv.local

or, in general, the url format will be:

* https://workbench.@<cluster>.<domain>@

By default, the provision script creates an initial user for testing purposes. This user is configured as administrator of the newly created cluster.

Assuming you didn't change the defaults, the initial credentials are:

* User: 'admin'
* Password: 'password'
* Email: 'admin@arva2.arv.local'
