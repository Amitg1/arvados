h2. Scheduling parameters

Parameters to be passed to the container scheduler (e.g., SLURM) when running a container.

h2(#priority). Priority

The @priority@ field has a range of 0-1000.

Priority 0 means no container should run on behalf of this request, and containers already running will be terminated (setting container priority to 0 is the cancel operation.)

Priority 1 is the lowest priority.

Priority 1000 is the highest priority.

The actual order that containers execute is determined by the underlying scheduling software (e.g. SLURM) based on a combination of container priority, submission time and available resources.

The magnitude of difference in priority between two containers affects the weight of priority vs age in determining scheduling order.  If two containers have only a small difference in priority (for example, 500 and 501) and the lower priority container has a longer queue time, the lower priority container may be scheduled before the higher priority container.  Use a greater magnitude difference (for example, 500 and 600) to give higher weight to priority over queue time.
