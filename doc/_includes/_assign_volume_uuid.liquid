Note that each volume has a UUID, like @zzzzz-nyw5e-0123456789abcde@. You assign these manually: replace @zzzzz@ with your Cluster ID, and replace @0123456789abcde@ with an arbitrary unique string of 15 alphanumerics. Once assigned, UUIDs should not be changed.

Essential configuration values are highlighted in <span class="userinput">red</span>.  Remaining parameters are provided for documentation, with their default values.
