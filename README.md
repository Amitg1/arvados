[Arvados](https://arvados.org) is a free software distributed computing platform
for bioinformatics, data science, and high throughput analysis of massive data
sets.  Arvados supports a variety of cloud, cluster and HPC environments.

Arvados consists of:

* *Keep*: a petabyte-scale content-addressed distributed storage system for managing and
  storing collections of files, accessible via HTTP and FUSE mount.

* *Crunch*: a Docker-based cluster and HPC workflow engine designed providing
  strong versioning, reproducibilty, and provenance of computations.

* Related services and components including a web workbench for managing files
  and compute jobs, REST APIs, SDKs, and other tools.

## Quick start

To try out Arvados on your local workstation, you can use Arvbox, which
provides Arvados components pre-installed in a Docker container (requires
Docker 1.9+).  After cloning the Arvados git repository:

```
$ cd arvados/tools/arvbox/bin
$ ./arvbox start localdemo
```

In this mode you will only be able to connect to Arvbox from the same host.  To
configure Arvbox to be accessible over a network and for other options see
http://doc.arvados.org/install/arvbox.html for details.

## Documentation

Complete documentation, including a User Guide, Installation documentation and
API documentation is available at http://doc.arvados.org/

If you wish to build the Arvados documentation from a local git clone, see
doc/README.textile for instructions.
