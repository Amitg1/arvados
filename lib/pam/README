Usage (in pam config):

    pam_arvados.so arvados_api_host my_vm_hostname ["insecure"] ["debug"]

pam_arvados.so passes authentication if (according to
arvados_api_host) the supplied PAM token belongs to an Arvados user
who is allowed to log in to my_vm_host_name with the supplied PAM
username.

If my_vm_hostname is omitted or "-", the current hostname is used.

"insecure" -- continue even if the TLS certificate presented by
arvados_api_host fails verification.

"debug" -- enable debug-level log messages in syslog and (when not in
"silent" mode) on the calling application's stderr.
